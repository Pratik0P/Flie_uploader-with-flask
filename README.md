I'll first extract the ZIP file and check its contents to create an appropriate README description. Let me do that now.

The ZIP file contains a directory named `file_uploader`. I'll now inspect its contents to generate a proper README description.

The `file_uploader` directory contains:  
1. `File_uploader.py` – Likely the main Python script for handling file uploads.  
2. `Flask_File_Uploader.txt` – Possibly documentation or notes about the project.  
3. `uploads/` – A directory, likely for storing uploaded files.  

It looks like a Flask-based file uploader. I'll now review the `.py` and `.txt` files to craft a proper README.

### Project Overview  
This project is a **Flask-based file uploader** that allows users to upload files through a web interface. The uploaded files are stored in a designated `uploads/` folder.

### Features  
- Simple web UI for file uploads  
- Uses Flask to handle HTTP requests  
- Saves uploaded files securely in the `uploads/` directory  

### Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd file_uploader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the application**  
   ```bash
   python File_uploader.py
   ```

4. **Access the web UI**  
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

Would you like any modifications or additional sections, like API details or deployment instructions?
